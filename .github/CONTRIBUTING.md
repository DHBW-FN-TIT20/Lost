# Contributing Guide
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.
To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull request
## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use Github issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issues.
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected to happen
- What acually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
## Use a Consistent Coding Style
- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
## Write meaningful Commits
Try to commit just single features, not multiple ones in one Commit.
- Find a fitting [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)
- Use the following format:
    ":sparkles: add feature/class/.. x"
- use simple present (don't write things you did, write things the Commit does.) 
    - **examples:**
        - not 'added x', choose 'add x'
        - not 'fixed bug y', write 'fix bug y'
- Write the main change in short in the heading
- Write some more info (e.g. in list style) in the extended text
