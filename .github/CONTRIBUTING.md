# Contributing Guide
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.
To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md). Here are some resources, which will help you get started with open source contributions:
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull request.
## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use Github issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary that describes the bug in it's core.
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- Describe the output, which you expected the program to give.
- Describe the actual output of the program.
- Useful notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, what you've already tried, etc.)
## Use a Consistent Coding Style
- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
## Write meaningful Commits
Try to commit every feature on it's own.
- Find a fitting [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)
- Use the following format:
    ":sparkles: add feature/class/.. x"
- use simple present (don't write what you did, write what your commit does!) 
    - **examples:**
        - not 'added x', choose 'add x'
        - not 'fixed bug y', write 'fix bug y'
- Try to be short and precise in the heading of the commit.
- Use the extended text to give more information.
